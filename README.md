**R**esource **D**istribution **Net**works

We test a Winner-Loser-Model and Null model based on the work of Hermanussen et al. 2023 \\
Additionally, we tax the agents based on their current ressource holding power (RHP), measured by the amount of owned token. We apply a 10% tax to agents (rounded to integers), who are able to pay the tribute, without ending up with a RHP of 0. The collected token get equally redistributed among all(!) agents, with the rest being caried over into the next iteration. The taxation process starts after agents have finished their interaction rounds. \\
